# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents (and new contributors) working in
OmniAccelerANT.

Laid out per ANTfrastructure's
[`shared/templates/AGENTS.md.template`](third_party/ANTfrastructure/shared/templates/README.md).
The rule that shapes it: *would this still be true in a different project?* If
yes, ANTfrastructure owns it and § 2 links to it. If no, it is written out in § 3.

## 1. What this project is

A Flutter/Dart app (`lib/`) targeting Windows, Linux, Android and web, with a
Rust core and a C++ inference plugin underneath it.

| Path | What lives there |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/` | The Flutter/Dart frontend |
| `third_party/OxidANT` | Rust core, bridged via `flutter_rust_bridge` — regenerate bindings with `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate` (a cargo binary baked into the build image, NOT a pub dependency; on a bare host `cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` first). `lib/src/rust/` is committed generated code — no build lane regenerates it |
| `packages/kataglyphis_native_inference` | C++ inference plugin — **plain files, not a submodule**; a `pubspec.yaml` path dependency. Links GStreamer + ONNX Runtime via CMake/pkg-config |
| `third_party/AccelerANTgine` | The inference core the plugin builds. Its own submodule, sibling to the plugin rather than nested inside it |
| `scripts/windows/`, `scripts/linux/` | Thin wrappers over ANTfrastructure drivers + this repo's own glue |
| `third_party/ANTfrastructure` | The submodule owning every reusable script, module and doc |

**Windows webcam inference.** The Stream page runs a Rust-owned
webcam → ONNX → Flutter-texture pipeline: `crates/media` GStreamer capture →
`src/webcam_engine.rs` → frb `src/api/webcam.rs` stream. Frames reach the texture
through the native plugin's `knt_push_frame` C ABI; only detection metadata
crosses the bridge. Gated by the Rust features
`gstreamer,onnxruntime_dynamic,onnxruntime_directml`, enabled on Windows via the
`KATAGLYPHIS_RUST_FEATURES` env var (forwarded to cargo by `rust_builder`'s
CMake → Cargokit). `mfvideosrc` needs the `mediafoundation` GStreamer plugin
**and** a Windows client host; it falls back to `ksvideosrc`. Details in
[`docs/source/camera-streaming.md`](docs/source/camera-streaming.md)
§ *Windows: Rust-owned webcam inference*.

## 2. What ANTfrastructure owns — links only

**Do not restate these procedures here.** Start at
[`third_party/ANTfrastructure/docs/INDEX.md`](third_party/ANTfrastructure/docs/INDEX.md),
which maps topic → owning document, so these links survive upstream
reorganisation.

| Topic | Where |
| --- | --- |
| The winamd64 image, Stevedore setup, `--isolation process`, the entrypoint vs `docker exec`, `docker commit` needing hyperv, the `wcifs` ENOENT class | `docs/windows-builds.md` |
| Bind mount vs tar-pipe, **Dev Drive filter setup**, container reuse, measured timings | `docs/windows-container-build-performance.md` |
| sccache's C++20-module blindness (clean + `SCCACHE_RECACHE=1` after a module-flag change) | `docs/windows-builds.md` |
| The image's pkg-config and rustup provisioning | `AGENTS.md` + `docs/windows-builds.md` |
| Wiring this repo to ANTfrastructure — resolver, actions, libraries | `docs/adopting-in-a-new-project.md` |
| Linux container builds | `docs/linux-build-basics.md` |
| Running the Linux lane locally on Windows (Rancher Desktop/nerdctl), and **a bind mount that resolves but is empty** — containerd's mount namespace, Windows vs WSL path form | `docs/rancher-desktop-linux-containers.md` |
| The five shell-safety bug classes | ANTfrastructure `AGENTS.md` § *Shell safety conventions* |
| appimagetool provisioning — pinned version + SHA256, not the moving `continuous` tag | `linux/scripts/02-toolchain/packaging-deps.sh`, subcommand `appimagetool` |
| Python venv + `uv` provisioning (installer downloaded to a file and SHA-checkable, never `curl \| sh`) | `linux/scripts/01-core/python_uv.sh` |
| The Dart gate for Linux lanes — deps, format, analyze, test, `--strict`/`--extra-package` | `linux/scripts/05-frameworks/flutter/flutter_checks.sh` |
| The CMake gate's machinery — `code_quality_find_cmake_files` + `CODE_QUALITY_CMAKE_EXCLUDE_PATHS` on Linux, `Initialize-UvVenvPython` on Windows | `linux/scripts/lib/code-quality.sh`, `windows/scripts/modules/WindowsFormatting.Common.psm1` |
| The canonical `.cmake-format.yaml` this repo's root copy syncs from, and the drift check | `shared/config/README.md` |
| Dependency upgrades — Renovate as a local CLI, why `--platform=local` only detects, the pinned Node/Renovate bootstrap, why `--apply` refuses a branchless submodule | `docs/dependency-updates.md` |

Two upstream facts repeated here only because they bite before you reach a doc:

- Every ANTfrastructure PowerShell module declares `#requires -Version 7.0`, so
  `Build-Windows.ps1` and `Start-Windows.ps1` do too — launch with `pwsh`, never
  `powershell`. Under 5.1 it fails as an opaque `Import-Module` error.
- Composite actions resolve at `@main`, so a ANTfrastructure change a workflow
  depends on must be pushed **before** the consumer change.

**This repo's glue** (deliberately thin):

- `scripts/windows/Resolve-BuildModule.ps1` — the one file that cannot live
  upstream, because it is what *finds* the submodule. `Import-BuildModule <Name>`
  checks ANTfrastructure first, then `scripts/windows/modules/`, which holds only
  genuinely project-specific modules (today: `WindowsPaths.Common`, encoding this
  repo's Flutter `build/windows/x64/{runner,plugins}` layout).
- `scripts/linux/lib/antfrastructure.sh` — the bash twin: `antfrastructure_source`
  and `antfrastructure_path`, resolved from `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` so they work from
  any working directory.

**Deliberately not reused.** Two upstream Windows pieces were evaluated and
rejected; both would be regressions here, so do not "fix" their absence:

- `WindowsAppRunner.Common` (`Invoke-AppRun` / `Resolve-AppExecutablePath`).
  Its executable probe tries `<BuildRoot>\<exe>` first and ends in a recursive
  first-match search. This tree holds **four** copies of the runner exe
  (`runner\`, `runner\Release\` from the MSIX layout step, `runner\<preset>\`,
  `runner\<preset>\Release\`), so it would launch the flat one and ignore
  `-Configuration` entirely. `Start-Windows.ps1` instead resolves through
  `Resolve-KataglyphisWindowsLayout`, which knows the preset layout and
  validates the Rust plugin DLL alongside the exe. `Invoke-AppRun` also has no
  log parameter, so adopting it would drop the `Tee-Object` run log.
- `Invoke-CmakeConfigureAndBuild` (`WindowsCMake.Common`). It makes `-Preset`
  mandatory (this repo also has a generator/`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` path), passes no
  `-S` source directory (the CMake source here is `windows/`, not the repo
  root), and offers no `--target` — but `--target install` is what produces the
  runner bundle. It also fuses configure and build into one step, while the
  `Native Assets Directory Fix` step must run between them.

## 3. Pitfalls specific to this project

Everything here is false or meaningless in another repo — that is why it is
written out rather than linked.

- **Six image gaps this repo used to work around are fixed in the image
  (2026-09-05); do not reintroduce the workarounds.** Each cost at least one run
  to diagnose, so the symptoms stay written down — if one reappears it is an
  image regression, not something to patch around again.
  `/opt/flutter/packages/flutter_tools/.dart_tool` was root-owned inside a
  **read-only overlay layer**, which a non-owner can neither empty nor rename
  (both were tried and refused); `flutter pub get` died with
  `package_config.json (OS Error: Permission denied, errno = 13)` and only a
  `--tmpfs …:rw,mode=1777` mount could mask it. `/opt/android-sdk` was fully
  populated but neither `ANDROID_HOME` nor `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` was in the image
  ENV, so `flutter build apk` stopped with `[!] No Android SDK found` — and
  because CodeQL wraps the build in `database create --command=…`, that
  surfaced three steps later as `needs to be finalized`. `SCCACHE_DIR` and
  `CCACHE_DIR` pointed into the mounted checkout, which pollutes the tree and
  on a bind-mounted host drive simply fails (`Can't initialize ccache use:
  Failed to set permissions`). `RUSTUP_HOME` and `CARGO_HOME` were `root:root`
  against a uid-1001 container (`could not create temp file …: Permission
  denied`; a hardlink copy is not a fix either — `protected_hardlinks` refuses
  root-owned files, and the `cp -a` fallback nests the tree so Corrosion reads
  an empty `rustc --version` and fails with `invalid value '' for
  '--toolchain'`). The `:latest-cross` tag was single-platform (own entry
  below), and there was no Java SDK. What remains is
  `setup_compiler_cache`, which now only calls ANTfrastructure's `setup_sccache`:
  that points `RUSTC_WRAPPER` and both CMake compiler launchers at the
  **guarded** `sccache-launcher.sh`, which survives sccache's own fatal errors
  when a CMake `TryCompile` deletes the scratch directory under it.

- **The Android GStreamer SDK is in the image but unannounced.** It sits at
  `/opt/android/gstreamer` as a flat prefix (`gst-android/ndk-build`,
  `include/`, `lib/`), yet `GSTREAMER_ROOT_ANDROID` is not in the image ENV, so
  the native plugin's `CMakeLists.txt` stops the Android lane at configure time
  with `GSTREAMER_ROOT_ANDROID must be set`. The plugin accepts both the
  per-ABI and the flat layout, so the path alone is enough.
  `export_android_gstreamer_env` (`scripts/linux/lib/container-steps.sh`)
  probes and exports it, and returns untouched when the variable is already
  set — so it becomes a no-op the moment the image exports it, **which is the
  real fix.**

- **Every Android SDK component must be pinned to what the image ships.**
  `/opt/android-sdk` is read-only, so any component the Android Gradle Plugin
  asks for and does not find cannot be installed — Gradle stops with
  `The SDK directory is not writable`, one component per run. AGP's defaults
  (build-tools 35.x, NDK 27/28.x, cmake 3.22.1) are all
  wrong for this image, which carries 36.0.0, 29.0.14206865 and 4.1.2. Four
  places pin them and must agree: the global `subprojects` override in
  `android/build.gradle.kts` (which also drags third-party plugins such as
  permission_handler up from their own `compileSdk 35`), plus `android/app`,
  the native plugin's `android/`, and `rust_builder/android/`. The override
  block has to sit **above** the `evaluationDependsOn(":app")` block —
  that one forces evaluation, and registering `afterEvaluate` afterwards throws
  `Cannot run Project.afterEvaluate(Action) when the project is already
  evaluated`. BACKLOG.md tracks collapsing these to one source of truth.

- **`--gcc-toolchain` is load-bearing here, and ANTfrastructure deleted the helper
  that set it.** `export_clang_gcc_toolchain_env` went away upstream on
  2026-09-05 (`e2c63f7b`), documented as dead: *"had no caller in the build […]
  nothing in the tree sets a bare `CC=clang`"*. Both statements are true of
  ANTfrastructure and false of this repo — `export_toolchain_env` set exactly that
  bare `CC=clang` and called the function. Upstream names
  `/usr/local/bin/clang-<arch>` as the replacement, because those wrappers bake
  `--gcc-toolchain` in themselves; **`:latest-cross` ships none of them**
  (`ls /usr/local/bin | grep clang` is empty), so that branch is preferred but
  never taken today. Two runs differing only in this flag settle what it is
  worth:

  | `CC` | result |
  | --- | --- |
  | `clang`, no flag | `clang++: error: linker command failed with exit code 1` |
  | `clang --gcc-toolchain=/opt/gcc-16.2.0` | bundle + all four packages |

  Without it clang resolves libstdc++ against the system copy rather than the
  source-built GCC 16.2.0 the image provides. `export_toolchain_env` restores
  the flags through `gcc_toolchain_prefix()`, which upstream kept — do not
  hard-code `/opt/gcc-16.2.0`.

  The wider lesson for every ANTfrastructure bump: upstream reasons about its own
  tree when it removes something. "No caller" means no caller *there*.

- **Editing a lane script while its container runs makes the log lie.** bash
  sources `container-steps.sh` once at start, so a later edit does not take
  effect — but the log then shows behaviour that no longer matches the file on
  disk, and the next reader (including you, ten minutes on) draws the wrong
  conclusion. This cost one run: the log said "falling back to bare clang" while
  the file already had the fix. Wait for the container to exit.

- **Rust `i64` is `int` natively and `BigInt` on web, so only the web lane
  catches the mismatch.** flutter_rust_bridge maps it to `PlatformInt64`, a
  typedef that resolves per platform, and app code that passes a plain `int`
  compiles everywhere except web:
  `Error: The argument type 'int' can't be assigned to the parameter type
  'BigInt'` — from `rust_webcam_view.dart`, in a widget whose own doc comment
  calls it the Windows view. Wrap the value in `PlatformInt64Util.from(...)`,
  which is the identity on native. It lives in
  `package:flutter_rust_bridge/flutter_rust_bridge_for_generated.dart`, not in
  the public `flutter_rust_bridge.dart`, and importing the generated binding
  does not bring it along — Dart does not re-export transitively.

- **The web lane needs the nightly toolchain's `rust-src`.**
  `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen build-web` runs `wasm-pack … -Z
  build-std=std,panic_abort`, so cargo compiles the standard library itself and
  stops without the component:
  `".../nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/Cargo.lock"
  does not exist, unable to build with the standard library`. The two `rustup`
  lines that fix it sat commented out in `ci-container-run-web-linux.sh` — they
  were disabled back when `RUSTUP_HOME` was root-owned and every `rustup` write
  failed. That is fixed in the image, so they are live again; both are
  idempotent and become no-ops once the image ships `rust-src` and the
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

- **Renaming the Rust crate touches committed generated code.**
  `lib/src/rust/frb_generated.dart` hard-codes the artefact name in
  `kDefaultExternalLibraryLoaderConfig`: `stem` (`oxidant` → `oxidant.dll`,
  `liboxidant.so`, `pkg/oxidant.js`) and `ioDirectory`
  (`third_party/OxidANT/target/release/`). No lane regenerates that file, so a
  `[lib] name` change in `Cargo.toml` stays silent until the app fails to load
  its library at runtime. Windows repeats the name a second time in
  `scripts/windows/Get-WindowsBuildConfig.ps1` (`RustDllName`,
  `RustPluginSubDir`). Change all three together.

- **`dbName` in `lib/src/db/sqlite3_loader_web.dart` is deliberately NOT the
  package name.** It still reads `kataglyphis_inference_engine` after the
  2026-09-05 rename to `omni_accelerant`, because it names the **IndexedDB
  database in the visitor's browser**, which backs the sqlite3 VFS. Changing it
  does not rename anything — it opens a *different, empty* database and orphans
  whatever the visitor had, with no error and no migration path. A rename here
  is a data migration, not a naming change, and it needs a copy step first. The
  string is invisible to everyone except the browser, so leaving it costs
  nothing. It also happens to be what keeps that call wrapped across three
  lines; the shorter name fits on one and `dart format` then rewrites the file.

- **The Android prebuilts are aarch64 now, and the lane's toolchain moved with
  them.** Until 2026-09-11 the image carried `ELF x86-64` GStreamer/ONNX
  Runtime/OpenCV under `/opt/android/` while the app builds `arm64-v8a`, so the
  link died on every archive with `incompatible with aarch64linux`. The image
  now ships only `arm64-v8a` (`libs/arm64-v8a`, `jni/abi-arm64-v8a`, and an
  aarch64 `libgstreamer-1.0.a` built by NDK r29), so the lane links.
  `abiFilters "arm64-v8a"` in the native plugin's `android/build.gradle` stays —
  real phones, not the emulator.
  AGP 9.4.0 + Gradle 9.7.1 builds that against four constraints, all
  load-bearing:

  - **Built-in Kotlin, with a declared KGP for the version check.**
    `android.builtInKotlin=true` and no `kotlin-android` plugin anywhere; AGP
    compiles Kotlin itself, and the target is set with
    `kotlin { compilerOptions { jvmTarget = … } }`. AGP bundles KGP 2.2.10,
    below Flutter's 2.2.20 floor, so `android/settings.gradle.kts` must keep
    `id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.android") version "2.4.20" apply false` — the
    declaration, not an application, is what raises the classpath KGP. Remove it
    and Flutter stops with `Your project's Kotlin version (2.2.10) is lower than
    Flutter's minimum supported version of 2.2.20`.
  - **`android.newDsl=false` stays.** The Flutter Gradle plugin still needs the
    legacy DSL types, AGP 9.4 marks them deprecated, and Gradle 9.7's Kotlin-DSL
    script compilation turns that into `Script compilation errors`. That is why
    `android/app/build.gradle.kts` opens with
    `@file:Suppress("DEPRECATION", "DEPRECATION_ERROR")`.
  - **Cargokit carries a Gradle 9 port.** `Project.exec` and `Project.buildDir`
    are gone in Gradle 9; `rust_builder/cargokit/gradle/plugin.gradle` injects
    `ExecOperations` and reads `project.layout.buildDirectory`. Upstream Cargokit
    still has the old calls, so keep this patch when bumping the vendored copy.
  - **`permission_handler_android` is pinned to 13.0.1** in
    `pubspec_overrides.yaml`. The 14.x that permission_handler 13.0.2 resolves
    needs `compileSdk 37`; the image ships android-36 and its SDK is read-only.
    Drop the pin when the image carries 37.

- **The Rust manifest path must be counted from the *resolved* plugin dir.**
  Cargokit builds `CARGOKIT_MANIFEST_DIR` by string-joining
  `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/${manifest_dir}`, and for a Flutter plugin that
  directory is the ephemeral symlink
  `linux/flutter/ephemeral/.plugin_symlinks/oxidant`
  — six levels deep, pointing at `rust_builder/`, which is two. The kernel
  resolves the symlink *before* applying the `..`, so a chain counted from the
  symlink overshoots to `/` and Dart reports
  `PathNotFoundException: … /third_party/OxidANT/Cargo.toml`.
  `rust_builder/linux/CMakeLists.txt` therefore takes `REALPATH` of
  `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` first, which yields `../..` and survives the
  resolution. Verified against a rebuilt directory tree: six `..` fails, two
  succeed.
  `rust_builder/windows/CMakeLists.txt` still has the original construct and is
  deliberately left alone — that lane is green, and it has its own
  `Fix Plugin Symlinks (Junctions)` build step. Do not "unify" the two without
  a full Windows container build to prove it.

- **Never `dart format .` here.** The lanes used to install the Flutter SDK
  *inside* the mounted workspace, so the recursive walk formatted the SDK
  itself. Run 33810449411 (2026-09-03) reported
  `Formatted 7404 files (627 changed)` with 604 of those under `flutter/` —
  by itself enough to fail `--set-exit-if-changed`, and it rewrote the SDK on
  disk on the way. Both lanes list tracked files instead:
  `code_quality_find_dart_files` on Linux, `Get-ProjectDartFiles` on Windows;
  they return the same 60 files. The SDK now comes from `/opt/flutter` in the
  image, so nothing lands in the tree any more — but keep the tracked-file
  listing: a stray `flutter/` from an older run is git-ignored and still on
  disk, and `third_party/` and `build/` would be walked regardless.
  `dart analyze` is *not* affected and never was: it honours the
  `analyzer.exclude` list in `analysis_options.yaml`, which already names
  `flutter/**`, `third_party/**` and `rust_builder/**`. `dart format` ignores
  that file entirely — which is the whole reason the file list has to be built
  outside it, and why the two helpers use exactly those three exclusions.

- **A single-arch image tag looks exactly like broken code.** Until 2026-09-04
  `ghcr.io/kataglyphis/kataglyphis_beschleuniger:latest-cross` was an amd64-only
  tag, so both matrix rows pulled the same digest and the arm64 row ran x86-64
  binaries on an `ubuntu-26.04-arm` runner:
  `` /usr/local/cargo/bin/rustc: 1: ELF: not found `` plus a corrosion
  `FindRust.cmake` error. Nothing in this repo could work around it. The tag is
  now a proper OCI index (amd64, arm64, riscv64) and the symptom is gone —
  verified by the pulled digest matching the registry's index digest, and by
  both rows failing identically afterwards instead of differently.
  Two things that survive from that hunt: `fail-fast: false` stays on the
  matrix, because the failing arm64 row used to cancel x64 before it finished
  and hid whether the healthy lane was green; and a `Failed to pull` line in a
  log is usually GitHub **echoing the retry script's source**, not running it —
  it cost hours of chasing a pull that had in fact succeeded.

- **ASAN works, but only against Microsoft's runtime.** LLVM's
  `clang_rt.asan_dynamic` loads *after* ucrtbase, so allocations made during
  CRT/COM startup are unhooked and it aborts with an unsuppressible `bad-free`
  when combase/ole32 frees them. That is a property of a COM-hosting Flutter
  app, not of the image. Microsoft's runtime (`VC\Tools\MSVC\<ver>\bin\Hostx64\x64\clang_rt.asan_dynamic-x86_64.dll`)
  tracks Windows heap ownership and passes foreign frees through. ANTfrastructure's
  `cmake/Sanitizers.cmake` (on the inference core's `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`; its local copy is retired)
  links Microsoft's thunk + import lib while keeping clang's instrumentation; `Start-Windows.ps1`
  stages the DLL next to the exe and sets
  `ASAN_OPTIONS=alloc_dealloc_mismatch=0:check_malloc_usable_size=0`.
  Build-time needs a dynamic CRT throughout (`-shared-libsan`, **no `/MT`
  overrides anywhere** — module BMIs re-emit `detect_mismatch` into importers, so
  one `/MT` BMI poisons everything).
- **The clangcl-Debug preset ships with ASAN ON** and builds + runs green (Dart
  VM up, camera live). Historic gotchas, all fixed: naive ASAN dragged `/MT`
  into Flutter's `/MD` objects (`lld-link` RuntimeLibrary mismatch), and
  `kataglyphis_libfuzzer.exe` hit an `annotate_string` mismatch vs
  `clang_rt.fuzzer`.
- **Each preset installs into its own directory** —
  `build\windows\x64\runner\<preset>\` (and `plugins\<preset>\`), because
  `Build-Windows.ps1`:367 resolves the layout per preset and :399/:408 pass that
  as `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. `x64-ClangCL-Windows-Release` is only the fallback
  used when no preset is named (`Get-WindowsBuildConfig.ps1`'s `CMakeConfiguration`).
  Presets no longer clobber each other — but `Start-Windows.ps1` must then be
  given the same preset name.
- **Running on an unprovisioned host** (`STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND`): stage the
  image's runtime DLLs into the runner (`C:\runtime\bin` + onnxruntime/DirectML →
  `runner\bin\`; `C:\runtime\lib\gstreamer-1.0` → `runner\lib\gstreamer-1.0\`).
  Two extra gotchas: `AccelerANTgine.dll` is built into a `bin\`
  **subdirectory** but the native plugin needs it **next to the exe**, and the
  VC++ redist CRT DLLs are not bundled. A healthy launch is ~130 MB with a real
  window; a ~6 MB process that exits means a missing dependency DLL. Full
  symptom table in [`docs/source/platforms.md`](docs/source/platforms.md).
- **Dart file ops fail on bind-mounted paths.** `copySync`/`renameSync` fail
  (plain writes and cmd `copy`/`ren` work), so junction `.dart_tool` and `build`
  from the mounted workspace to container-local dirs before building. The
  bind-mount setup itself is upstream's — see § 2.
- **The native plugin needs pkg-config** and the image's baked
  `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` (GStreamer/FFmpeg/OpenCV `.pc` files under `C:\runtime`).
  Whether the image ships a pkg-config binary is upstream's problem; needing it
  is ours.
- **Cargokit hard-requires rustup.** The `rust_builder` Flutter plugin builds
  its crate via Cargokit during CMake install, and Cargokit will not use a
  scoop-only Rust. Install rustup **with a default toolchain**; only
  toolchain-less rustup shims are harmful.
- **Vendored ANTLR** (pulled in unconditionally by newer FUZZTEST) needs
  `WITH_STATIC_CRT OFF`, `ANTLR_BUILD_CPP_TESTS OFF`, `ANTLR_BUILD_SHARED OFF`,
  `/FIchrono`, and `LICENSE.txt` staged at the build root — its install rule
  assumes a monorepo layout. Wired up in
  `third_party/AccelerANTgine/third_party/CMakeLists.txt` — the inference core's
  own dependency list, not the plugin's.

## 4. Build, run, test

**Both lanes run the same thing locally and in CI. Reproduce locally first —
CI is not a debugger.**

**Run one lane at a time.** Every local lane bind-mounts the *same* checkout,
and the generated files at its root are per-host, not per-lane:
`android/local.properties` carries `flutter.sdk`, and the ephemeral plugin
symlinks, `.dart_tool` and `ios/macos` `Generated.*` carry absolute paths. Two
lanes running together overwrite each other mid-build, and the failure names
neither of them — a Windows container run and a Linux Android run in parallel
left `flutter.sdk=C:\ProgramData\scoop\apps\flutter\current` next to
`sdk.dir=/opt/android-sdk`, and Gradle stopped with
`Could not read script '/workspace/android/C:/ProgramData/…/native_plugin_loader.gradle.kts'`.
CI never sees this: each lane is its own runner with its own clone.

Windows builds run containerized, and **CI runs the exact same script** — the
workflow [`dart_on_native_windows.yml`](.github/workflows/dart_on_native_windows.yml)
calls `Build-Windows.ps1` through ANTfrastructure's `run-in-windows-container`
action, so "works locally" and "works in CI" are the same steps by construction.
Locally:

```powershell
& "$env:ProgramFiles\Stevedore\bin\docker.exe" run --rm --isolation process `
  --mount "type=bind,source=$PWD,target=C:\ws-mnt" -w C:\ws-mnt `
  ghcr.io/kataglyphis/kataglyphis_beschleuniger:winamd64 `
  pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\ws-mnt\scripts\windows\Build-Windows.ps1 `
    -SkipMsixPackaging
```

`-SkipMsixPackaging` alone is exactly what the workflow passes; adding
`-Configurations` is a deliberate deviation, not the parity run. Verified
2026-09-06: 22/22 steps, process exit 0, `omni_accelerant.exe` and
`oxidant.dll` under
`build\windows\x64\runner\x64-ClangCL-Windows-Release\`, `AccelerANTgine.dll`
under `build\windows\x64\bin\`. That directory is never cleaned, so the
pre-rename `kataglyphis_inference_engine.exe`,
`kataglyphis_rustprojecttemplate.dll` and `CppInference.dll` still sit beside
them — compare timestamps, not presence, when checking a rename.

The Windows engine is Stevedore's, **not** Rancher Desktop's — Rancher only
serves Linux containers, and its `docker`/`nerdctl` shims are first on `PATH`,
so the full path above is load-bearing. **Run it in the container, not on the
host.** The host's `cmake` is Strawberry Perl's 3.29.2 out of
`C:\Strawberry\c\bin`, which shadows anything newer and fails
`cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.31.6)` at configure; the image carries 4.4.0.

**The mount target must not already exist in the image.** `target=C:\workspace`
fails at container creation with `hcs::CreateComputeSystem ... The request is not
supported` on hosts whose Docker/hcsshim is version-skewed from the image —
`C:\workspace` is a baked image dir. Use a fresh target (`C:\ws-mnt` above; CI
mounts `D:\ws → C:\ws`). ANTfrastructure owns the why — see § 2.

Four quality/output steps run before the native build (`-CodeQL` short-circuits
before them), each skippable with the paired switch: **Dart format + CMake
format** (`-SkipFormat`), **Dart analyze + Flutter tests** (`-SkipTests`),
**API docs generation** (`-SkipDocs`).

**A failed step does not abort the run.** None of them is declared `-Critical`,
and `-StopOnError` is off by default, so the step is recorded and the build
carries on — the log still ends with `=== Build Complete ===` even when
something failed, and the script only exits 1 from its `finally` block. A real
run shows both lines together (`FAILED: MSIX Packaging` … `=== Build Complete ===`).
**Trust the process exit code and `failedSteps` in `logs/build-summary-*.json`,
never the log tail.**

Two Windows-specific traps these steps carry:

- The format gate formats `lib test integration_test test_driver`, **not `.`**:
  `dart format .` recurses into `.git`, and the deeply nested vendored submodule
  gitdir exceeds Windows MAX_PATH, so the listing throws and the gate crashes
  before formatting anything.
- Docs generation does **not** use the SDK-bundled `dart doc`. The dartdoc 9.0.4
  in the current image crashes on *any* Flutter app — a `_stripDocImports`
  RangeError while precaching the Flutter SDK's own `@docImport` comments
  (reproduced with a bare `flutter create`). The step `pub global activate
  dartdoc` (≥ 9.0.9, which fixes it) and runs that. This is really an image bug;
  ANTfrastructure should ship a newer dartdoc.

- Preset aliases: `clangcl-{debug,profile,release}`, `msvc-{debug,release}`,
  `clang-{debug,profile,release}` → `x64-ClangCL-Windows-Debug` etc.
- Switches: `-SkipTests`, `-SkipFormat`, `-SkipDocs`, `-CleanBuild`, `-SkipMsixPackaging`,
  `-SkipBootstrapFlutterBuild`, `-ContinueOnError`/`-StopOnError`, `-CodeQL`. The
  closing **Delivery Check** cannot be skipped.
- Logs land in `logs/` (`build-windows-*.log` + `build-summary-*.json`); API
  docs in `doc/api` (git-ignored).

**MSIX packaging.** `msix_config.build_windows` is `false` on purpose: this
script owns the build, and a second `flutter build windows` driven by msix
would only re-run — with a different generator — what the presets already
produced. (Until 2026-09-06 it also tripped over a `CMakeCache.txt` synced back
from the container-local build root — *"the current CMakeCache.txt directory …
is different than the directory … where it was created"*. ANTfrastructure's
`Sync-FastLocalArtifactsToHost` now excludes `CMakeCache.txt` and `CMakeFiles`
from the sync-back, so the host tree gets artifacts, not CMake state.) The
**MSIX Compatibility Layout** step exists because msix looks for
`build\windows\x64\runner\Release\`, while the build installs to
`runner\<preset>\`; it copies the preset's output into that flat `Release\`.
Both halves were broken until 2026-09-03 and nobody noticed, because CI passes
`-SkipMsixPackaging` — packaging is only exercised locally.

**The CI lane** ([`dart_on_native_windows.yml`](.github/workflows/dart_on_native_windows.yml))
is four ANTfrastructure actions and nothing hand-rolled:
`prepare-windows-container-host` (long paths, short-path clone, data-root move,
disk check, GHCR login, pull), `run-in-windows-container`,
`actions/upload-artifact` and `upload-codeql-sarif`. Three consequences:

- It prunes `third_party/DocumANTation` from the recursive checkout.
  This repo's chains are OmniAccelerANT → AccelerANTgine → ANTfrastructure →
  DocumANTation → md2pdfLib → `third_party/{smile,awesome-beamer}` and the same
  tail via OxidANT, and every level adds another
  `.git/modules/<name>/` segment until git aborts with `fatal: '$GIT_DIR' too
  big` — git's own limit, not MAX_PATH, so no clone root is short enough.

  **Resolved on 2026-09-05.** Measured by the `gitdir:` string each gitfile
  carries, at each step of the way:

  | chain | before | after md2pdfLib | after ANTfrastructure |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `ANTfrastructure` directly | 180 ok | 158 ok | 149 ok |
  | via `AccelerANTgine` | 230 **fatal** | 208 ok | 199 ok |
  | via `OxidANT` | 238 **fatal** | 216 **fatal** | 207 ok |

  Two directory renames did it, neither of them a repository rename:
  `md2pdfLib/presentation/template/latex/` → `md2pdfLib/third_party/` inside
  DocumANTation, and `external/Kataglyphis-DocumANTation` →
  `third_party/DocumANTation` inside ANTfrastructure. Each saved segment counts
  **twice**, once in the worktree path and once in the `gitdir` string, which is
  why 25 characters behaved like 50. The threshold sits between 208 and 216.

  Renaming the repositories on GitHub did **not** help here and was not meant
  to: a submodule's directory comes from its `path` entry, not from the repo
  name. DocumANTation is ANTfrastructure's LaTeX tooling and the Windows build
  never reads it.

  The numbers above were measured before `ExternalLib/` became `third_party/`.
  That move shortens the chain further, but **only in a fresh clone**: git names
  `.git/modules/<name>` after the `[submodule "<name>"]` header, and it keeps an
  existing module directory when a submodule is moved in place. So `.gitmodules`
  here reads `third_party/OxidANT` while this checkout's gitfile still says
  `gitdir: ../../.git/modules/ExternalLib/Kataglyphis-RustProjectTemplate` — 23
  characters that CI, which always clones fresh, does not pay. Reproduce with
  `cat third_party/*/.git`. A local checkout is therefore the *worst* case; if it
  resolves, CI does too.
- `mount-source`/`mount-target` stay unset: the action already defaults to
  `D:\ws` → `C:\ws`, which is where the short-path clone put the tree. Setting
  them to `github.workspace` would mount the submodule-less checkout instead.
- Artifact paths are therefore **absolute under the short-path clone**
  (`steps.prep.outputs.workspace`), never relative to `github.workspace`. A
  relative path matches nothing there, and `if-no-files-found: error` would
  report that as a missing build. `upload-codeql-sarif` exists for the same
  reason: `hashFiles()` only sees inside `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`.

CI passes `-SkipMsixPackaging`, and `-CodeQL` is off there because of runtimes.

### The Linux lane, locally

`scripts/linux/Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1` starts the same image and runs the same script
with the same arguments as that lane's workflow. `-Lane` selects which:

| `-Lane` | script | workflow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `native` (default) | `ci-container-run-native-linux.sh` | [`dart_on_native_linux.yml`](.github/workflows/dart_on_native_linux.yml) |
| `android` | `ci-container-run-android.sh` | [`dart_build_android_app.yml`](.github/workflows/dart_build_android_app.yml) |
| `web` | `ci-container-run-web-linux.sh` | [`dart_on_web_linux.yml`](.github/workflows/dart_on_web_linux.yml) |

Each entry mirrors its workflow's `extra-args` and `script`, so change the pair
together. The argument sets are meant to match exactly — the android lane also
matches in *not* passing `--privileged`.

```powershell
.\scripts\linux\Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1 -SkipCodeQL -SkipDocs            # native, x64
.\scripts\linux\Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1 -Lane android -SkipCodeQL
.\scripts\linux\Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1 -Lane web
.\scripts\linux\Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1 -Arch arm64                      # needs QEMU, see below
```

**arm64 locally needs QEMU registered once per VM boot.** Rancher's VM starts
with no emulators at all — `binfmt` reports `"emulators": null` and only
`linux/amd64` variants under `supported`, so an arm64 container would run
x86-64 binaries and die exactly as CI did before the image went multi-arch
(`rustc: 1: ELF: not found`). Register it with:

```powershell
nerdctl run --rm --privileged tonistiigi/binfmt --install arm64
nerdctl run --rm --privileged tonistiigi/binfmt          # verify: qemu-aarch64 listed
nerdctl run --rm --platform linux/arm64 alpine uname -m  # verify: aarch64
```

Like the `D:` mount in containerd's namespace, this does not survive a VM
restart. The arm64 layers are a separate pull — about 6 GB over the wire, 30 GB
on disk next to the amd64 copy (`nerdctl pull --platform linux/arm64 …`) — and
every compile then runs under emulation, so expect it to be far slower than the
native x64 lane.

**Emulated arm64 produces tar and deb, never flatpak or AppImage.** Both fail
inside `qemu-user`, for reasons that have nothing to do with this repo or the
image, and both were verified 2026-09-05 after a full arm64 build that compiled
Rust and C++ without a single error:

- `bwrap: Creating new namespace failed, likely because the kernel does not
  support user namespaces` — the kernel does support them
  (`/proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces` is 123100) and `--privileged` is passed;
  qemu-user simply does not carry `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` through, and
  flatpak-builder sandboxes every module with bubblewrap.
- `/usr/local/bin/appimagetool: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error` —
  the binary is the correct architecture (`ELF aarch64, static-pie linked`);
  qemu-user cannot load static-PIE executables.

CI is unaffected: its arm64 row runs on a real `ubuntu-26.04-arm` runner, so
neither restriction applies. Locally, treat a failing flatpak/AppImage step on
arm64 as expected and check the two messages above before investigating.

**Everything write-heavy must stay off the host mount.** A bind-mounted Windows
drive cannot do `utime`, `chmod` or `fchmod` for the container uid, and each of
those surfaces as a different, misleading error:

| What | Where it lives now | Symptom when it did not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CMake/ninja build tree | named volume on `/workspace/build` | — |
| flatpak repo, build tree, builder state, manifest staging **and the finished bundle** | `/tmp/flatpak-work` | `fchmod: Operation not permitted`, first from the OSTree repo, later from `build-bundle` |
| ccache / sccache | `/var/cache/{ccache,sccache}`, set by the image | `Can't initialize ccache use: Failed to set permissions` |

Only the finished artifacts are written into `out/`. This is ANTfrastructure's
documented rule for build directories and caches, applied to the packaging
steps as well.

**`error: fchmod` after `Pruning cache` is not the prune.** That combination cost
hours. `Pruning cache` is merely flatpak-builder's *last* output line; it exits
0. The error underneath came from `flatpak build-bundle`, which chmods the file
it writes — and that file was `out/…flatpak`, on the host mount. The bundle is
now written under `/tmp/flatpak-work` and copied out afterwards. `set -x` around
the function answered this in one run, after three rounds of eliminating
plausible-looking causes had only moved the symptom.

The step also does **not** gate on flatpak-builder's exit code any more. It asks
`ostree --repo=<repo> refs` whether the app is committed, because the export can
be complete while a later stage fails. The exit code is reported in the warning,
never used as the verdict.

All four formats build locally on x64: tar, deb, flatpak and AppImage. The
appimagetool mode-711 problem that used to break the last one is fixed in the
image.

It drives Rancher Desktop's `nerdctl` (found on `PATH`, else under
`%ProgramFiles%`), because that is the local Linux engine on this box; CI uses
`docker` through ANTfrastructure's `run-in-linux-container`. Everything inside the
container is identical.

**`-v name:/path` is not a named volume on Windows nerdctl.** It is a bind of
`$PWD/name`, created silently, and `nerdctl volume create` beforehand changes
nothing — the volume is made and never mounted. Proof: after five lane runs,
`%TEMP%` held `kataglyphis-lane-native-x64-workspace-build/` and four siblings,
729 MB each, while the volume of that name mounted through
`--mount type=volume,…` was empty. One run started from the repo root even left
a 151 MB directory of that name *in the checkout*. So the whole point of the
volumes — keeping the write-heavy build tree off drvfs — was never in effect
locally, and the failures it prevents were only avoided because the packaging
steps had already been moved to `/tmp`. `Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1` now always uses
`--mount type=volume,source=…,target=…`, which nerdctl cannot reinterpret as a
path. CI is unaffected: there the Linux engine resolves the short form
correctly.

`flutter clean` then logs `Failed to remove /workspace/build … Device or
resource busy (errno 16)` on every run and keeps going: it empties the
directory but cannot unlink the mount point itself. Cosmetic, and the direct
consequence of mounting `build/` — not a failure to chase.

**Two traps, both of which produce a mount that resolves but is empty:**

- `D:` must exist inside *containerd's own* mount namespace, which is not the
  distro's. It is transient — gone after the VM restarts:

  ```pwsh
  wsl -d rancher-desktop -u root -e sh -c 'pid=$(ps -eo pid,comm | awk "\$2==\"containerd\" {print \$1; exit}"); nsenter -t "$pid" -m -- sh -c "mkdir -p /mnt/d && mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/d"'
  ```

  Without it the bind silently mounts an empty directory that containerd
  helpfully *creates*, so the path then exists and stays empty.
- Pass the **Windows** path (`D:\…`). nerdctl translates it itself; handing it
  the already-translated `/mnt/d/…` bypasses that and binds nothing. ANTfrastructure
  owns the full write-up — see § 2.

`wsl: Failed to translate '<cwd>'` in the output is noise: `wsl.exe` cannot map
the *current directory* when it is on `D:`. It does not affect the mount.

No lane installs Flutter. `assert_flutter_available` checks that one exists at
`--flutter-dir` and reports the version it found; whatever the image carries is
what gets used. A multi-GB `flutter/` in the repo is a leftover from before
that — git-ignored, and safe to remove.

Run the app on the host once artifacts are back:

```powershell
# -Configuration is required: it names the runner\<preset>\ directory to launch.
.\scripts\windows\Start-Windows.ps1 -Configuration x64-ClangCL-Windows-Release
.\scripts\windows\Start-Windows.ps1 -Configuration x64-ClangCL-Windows-Debug
```

Linux builds run containerized. **CI does not use the stage script below.** Its
path is the ANTfrastructure composite action
`.github/actions/run-in-linux-container@main`, which runs
`scripts/linux/ci/ci-container-run-native-linux.sh` *inside* the container with
CLI flags, not env vars
([`dart_on_native_linux.yml`](.github/workflows/dart_on_native_linux.yml):60,70-78):

```bash
bash /workspace/scripts/linux/ci/ci-container-run-native-linux.sh \
  --arch x64 --build-mode release --flutter-dir /opt/flutter \
  --app-name omni-accelerant \
  --package-formats tar,deb,flatpak,appimage
```

`--flutter-dir` only says *where* to look; it defaults to `/opt/flutter`. There
is no `--install-flutter` and no `--flutter-version` — see *Flutter comes from
the image* below.

There is no separate host-side driver any more. The legacy
`ci-dart-on-native-linux.sh` / `ci-dart-build-android-app.sh` pair and their
`ci-common.sh` were removed on 2026-09-04: no workflow ever referenced them,
they carried a third copy of the CodeQL logic, and they re-implemented what CI
actually runs instead of invoking it. Use `Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1` (§ 4), which
runs the very script CI runs.

**Flutter comes from the image, and this repo does not have an opinion about
which version.** It used to: three lanes resolved `FLUTTER_VERSION` and
`FLUTTER_SDK_SHA256` out of ANTfrastructure's `versions.env`, exported the sha, and
handed both to an installer. That machinery is gone — `resolve_flutter_pin`,
`setup_flutter_sdk`, `install-flutter.sh` and the `--flutter-version` /
`--install-flutter` flags with it. `assert_flutter_available` replaces all of
it: it fails if `--flutter-dir` holds no `bin/flutter`, and otherwise reports
the `frameworkVersion` it found and moves on.

Why it went: the lanes were re-running ANTfrastructure's `setup-flutter.sh` at
*run* time. That script is a build-stage script — its last step strips
`bin/cache` on purpose — so every Android run re-extracted Flutter over the
image's copy and then re-downloaded the 227 MB Dart SDK it had just deleted.
Upstream now returns early when the requested version is already bootstrapped,
and this repo no longer calls it at all.

To change the Flutter version, change the image.

The lane scripts take their inputs as CLI flags and exit 2 on a missing
required one rather than guessing — `--arch`, `--app-name` and (native only)
`--package-formats`. `--flutter-dir` defaults to `/opt/flutter`. The matrix
values CI passes are in
[`dart_on_native_linux.yml`](.github/workflows/dart_on_native_linux.yml).

**`--app-name` derives from `pubspec.yaml`; do not hard-code it again.**
`resolve_app_name` in `scripts/linux/lib/cli-common.sh` reads the `name:` entry
and swaps `_` for `-`, so `omni_accelerant` yields `omni-accelerant`.
`run-native-linux.sh`, `run-android.sh` (which appends `-apk`),
`package-linux.sh` and `Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1` all default through it. Before
2026-09-05 the literal sat in all four plus the workflows, seven copies that a
rename had to find. The workflows still pass the value explicitly, which is
what keeps CI independent of a host's `pwd`.

**`build_linux` on `x64` is not just a build — it is a full CodeQL run.** That
branch downloads the CodeQL CLI, builds a `--db-cluster` for c/cpp/rust and runs
two `database analyze` suites; the actual `flutter build linux --release` only
appears inside the generated `/tmp/codeql-build.sh` that CodeQL invokes. Budget
hours, not minutes. The `arm64` branch is the plain
`flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter build linux --release`. To build the
app on x64 without the scan, pass `-SkipCodeQL` to `Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1`.

`FLUTTER_DIR` defaults to `/opt/flutter` — the image's SDK, shared by every
lane and never written to. It used to default inside the workspace, which made
an x64 and an arm64 run in the same tree overwrite each other's SDK; that is
gone along with the installer.

Quality gates — `Build-Windows.ps1` runs these by default (skip with
`-SkipFormat` / `-SkipTests` / `-SkipDocs`). Note the format command is **not**
`dart format .`: that is the form documented above as crashing on Windows.

```bash
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test integration_test test_driver
cmake-format -c .cmake-format.yaml --check <the hand-maintained CMake files>
flutter analyze
flutter test
dart pub global run dartdoc --output doc/api
```

The Linux `checks` stage runs the same three (with `dart analyze` rather than
`flutter analyze`) but suffixes each with `|| true`: it reports and moves on
instead of failing the stage. Treat a green `checks` run as "was executed", not
as "passed". The CMake gate NO LONGER follows that switch.
`run_cmake_format_check` takes no arguments at all now: it used to accept a
strictness flag and IGNORE its own verdict when that flag was false, so it errors
(exit 2) if handed one rather than letting a stale caller pass silently. It runs in
the native-Linux lane and the Android lane and is FATAL in both; the web lane builds
no native CMake code and does not run it.

That flip is safe for a measured reason, not an optimistic one: the gate's 13 files
are already clean under this repo's `.cmake-format.yaml`, and the native-Linux lane
has passed `--strict-checks true` since fc8b65c — so any drift the Android lane now
catches is drift that already blocks the merge on the other lane. Wrap the call in
`run_gate` when you want the batch to decide, rather than reaching for a flag.

**The CMake format gate covers hand-maintained CMake only — 13 files today.**
Both lanes build the same list (`run_cmake_format_check` in
`scripts/linux/lib/container-steps.sh`; the `CMake Format Verification` step in
`Build-Windows.ps1`) and both exclude, each verified generated or vendored:
`third_party/` and `build/`; `*/flutter/CMakeLists.txt` (header: "It should not
be edited"); `*/generated_plugins.cmake` ("Generated file, do not edit");
`*/ephemeral/` (rewritten on every `pub get`); `*/.cxx/` (Android Gradle's CMake
build trees); `*/.plugin_symlinks/` (pub's junction farm);
`rust_builder/cargokit/` (vendored — its README opens with "copied from
Cargokit"); `.venv/` (created by the gate's own bootstrap). Do not widen the
gate onto any of those: it would fight the generator or upstream.

`.cmake-format.yaml` at the root is the consumer copy of ANTfrastructure's
canonical config — `shared/config/README.md` owns why it is a copy. Refresh it
with `pwsh -File third_party/ANTfrastructure/shared/config/Sync-SharedConfig.ps1
-RepoRoot . -Write -Ignore
'.clang-format,.clang-tidy,gcovr.cfg,.pre-commit-config.yaml'`. That `-Ignore`
list is deliberate, not drift: of the five shared configs this Flutter app
carries only `.cmake-format.yaml` — nothing here runs clang-format, clang-tidy,
gcovr or the C++ pre-commit hooks. cmake-format itself comes from `PATH` or a
uv venv fed by ANTfrastructure's pinned
`third_party/ANTfrastructure/linux/scripts/cmake-format.requirements.txt` — there
is no root `requirements.txt` (`pyyaml` sits in that pinned set because
cmake-format cannot read its own YAML config without it). Both bootstraps read
that one file: `run_cmake_format_check` in
`scripts/linux/lib/container-steps.sh` and the "CMake Format Verification" step
in `scripts/windows/Build-Windows.ps1`. The config's
`line_ending: unix` is why `.gitattributes` pins `CMakeLists.txt` and `*.cmake`
to LF — a `core.autocrlf=true` checkout would otherwise fail `--check` on every
file.

### Dependency upgrades

**Submodule upgrades go through this, not by hand.** Nothing in
`.github/workflows/` runs it; it blocks no commit.

**Report-first (owner directive 2026-09-11): a run reports. `-Apply` only when the
owner explicitly asked for it in that turn.**

On this host, run it in the cross container:

```powershell
.\scripts\linux\Invoke-Renovate.ps1                      # what is behind
.\scripts\linux\Invoke-Renovate.ps1 -Apply -DryRun       # the plan
.\scripts\linux\Invoke-Renovate.ps1 -Apply               # apply the plan
.\scripts\linux\Invoke-Renovate.ps1 -Managers pub        # narrow the managers
.\scripts\linux\Invoke-Renovate.ps1 -Recurse             # owned submodules, in place
```

`scripts/linux/renovate-local.sh` remains the language-independent entry point
(every lane and Linux host calls it); the PowerShell runner only wires it to
`nerdctl`: it mounts the repo at `/workspace`, adds the `safe.directory`
entries the root-owned bind mount needs (`/workspace` and `/workspace/*` for the
submodule worktrees), and forwards `-Apply`/`-DryRun`/`-Refresh`/
`-Managers`/`-PrintBin`.

**Why the container still downloads its own Node.** Renovate declares
`engines.node ^24.11.0` and hard-exits on anything else, so the image's Node
26.8.1 cannot run it (`Unsupported node environment detected`). The
checksum-pinned Node 24.21.0 + Renovate 44.82.0 bootstrap stays, cached on the
`kataglyphis-renovate-cache` named volume, so the download happens once per host
instead of once per container.

**The runner passes `gh`'s token as `GITHUB_COM_TOKEN` when `gh` is
authenticated.** Without it Renovate's GitHub API lookups are rate-limited and it
can report stale GitHub Actions as up to date — DocumANTation's action majors
were invisible until a token was supplied.

`-Recurse` walks the initialized submodules, keeps the Kataglyphis-owned ones,
dedups them by remote identity (one canonical checkout per repo, the shallowest
copy), orders them dependencies-first, and runs the same script in each —
ANTfrastructure after DocumANTation, AccelerANTgine/OxidANT after ANTfrastructure.
It writes into the vendored worktrees in place, which upstream's
`renovate-fleet.sh` refuses by design: after an `-Apply`, commit and push each
submodule, then move the gitlinks in every superproject that vendors it.

Renovate is a local CLI and only **detects** — `--platform=local` cannot write —
so the `--apply` half is this repo's own code: git for gitlinks and a located
line rewrite for the manifests it reported. Managers default to **every manager
whose file patterns match this tree** (eight today), so `--managers` narrows the
run rather than enabling it. `--apply` needs the git that *wrote* the working
tree; the script sorts that out itself and refuses up front rather than
half-applying. Why any of it —
[`third_party/ANTfrastructure/docs/dependency-updates.md`](third_party/ANTfrastructure/docs/dependency-updates.md).

## 5. Docs owned by this repo

- Guides live in `docs/source/` (MyST Markdown, Sphinx via `docs/make.bat` /
  `Makefile`); Dart API docs via `dart doc`.
- [`docs/source/platforms.md`](docs/source/platforms.md) holds the full
  symptom→cause→fix table for containerized Windows builds.
- `docs/source/conf.py` still uses the standalone `press` theme. The shared
  Sphinx theme now lives in **DocumANTation** (ANTfrastructure consumes
  it as a submodule and installs it as `sphinx-kataglyphis-theme`); follow that
  pattern if migrating.
- Update docs in the same PR as user-facing behaviour changes.
