## Overview

OmniAccelerANT bundles a Flutter/Dart frontend, a Rust/C++ inference core, and a rich set of camera streaming pipelines powered by GStreamer. The repository acts as an end-to-end reference for building cross-platform inference products that target desktop, web, and embedded devices.

## Highlights & Key Features – OmniAccelerANT

### 🌟 Highlights

- 🎨 **GStreamer native GTK integration** – Leveraging users to write beautiful Linux AI inference apps.
- 📹 **GStreamer WebRTC livestreaming** with ready-to-use pipelines for USB, Raspberry Pi, and Orange Pi cameras.
- 🌉 **flutter_rust_bridge integration** – Ensures a seamless API boundary between Dart UI and Rust logic.
- 🐳 **Containerized development flow** plus native instructions for Windows, Linux, web. For details in my build environment look into [ContainerHub](https://github.com/Kataglyphis/ContainerHub). On Windows the container engine is [Stevedore](https://github.com/slonopotamus/stevedore) and build containers run with `--isolation process` (full host CPU count) — see [docs/source/platforms.md](docs/source/platforms.md).
- 🐍 **Python inference demos** for rapid experimentation alongside the Rust core.

#### Platform Summary

| Platform | Architecture | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|:------:|-------|
| 🪟 **Windows** | x86-64 | ✔️ | Built with clang-cl, Win32 integration |
| 🐧 **Linux** | x86-64 | ✔️ | Full GTK support, Docker ready |
| 🐧 **Linux** | ARM64 | ✔️ | SBC optimized (RPi, OPi support) |
| 🐧 **Linux** | RISC-V | 🔶 | Emerging architecture support. No CI lane in this repo — the `:latest-cross` image index carries a riscv64 variant, but nothing builds against it here. |
| 🤖 **Android** | ARM64 | 🔶 | Native camera, NDK integration. The app targets `arm64-v8a` only; the CI image currently ships its Android GStreamer/ONNX/OpenCV prebuilts for x86-64, so the native library cannot link. Everything up to and including the compile step is green. |

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository with submodules:  
  > **__NOTE:__**
  > On Windows I use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/install/windows) instead of  
  > Powershell or cmd
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules --branch develop git@github.com:Kataglyphis/OmniAccelerANT.git
   cd OmniAccelerANT
   ```
2. Initialize submodules if needed.  
   If u used `--recurse-submodules` while cloning you are already good.  
   Otherwise you can use this :smile:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

Refer to the detailed docs below for platform-specific requirements, camera streaming pipelines, and deployment workflows.

3. Build the app. **Every lane runs containerized, and local runs invoke the
   same script CI invokes** — the exact commands, presets and switches are in
   [AGENTS.md § 4](AGENTS.md#4-build-run-test):

   | Lane | What CI runs | Locally |
   |---|---|---|
   | Windows (amd64) | `scripts/windows/Build-Windows.ps1` | the same script, in the same image |
   | Linux native (amd64 / arm64) | `scripts/linux/ci/ci-container-run-native-linux.sh` | `Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1` |
   | Android | `scripts/linux/ci/ci-container-run-android.sh` | `Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1 -Lane android` |
   | Web | `scripts/linux/ci/ci-container-run-web-linux.sh` | `Invoke-LinuxLane.ps1 -Lane web` |

   The Linux entries go through ContainerHub's `run-in-linux-container` action
   in CI and Rancher Desktop's `nerdctl` locally; inside the container the two
   are identical, down to the argument list. Reproduce a CI failure locally
   before pushing — that is the whole point of the arrangement.

   Note that the Linux `build_linux` stage runs a full CodeQL analysis on `x64`,
   not just a build — see AGENTS.md before starting one.

   Building the Linux lane locally on a Windows host has host-side
   prerequisites — Rancher Desktop's engine, the drive the repo lives on being
   visible to *containerd's own* mount namespace, and QEMU binfmt registered
   for an arm64 run. The concrete commands are in
   [AGENTS.md § 4](AGENTS.md#4-build-run-test), "The Linux lane, locally";
   the reasoning behind them is ContainerHub's, in
   [`rancher-desktop-linux-containers.md`](third_party/ContainerHub/docs/rancher-desktop-linux-containers.md).
   Both prerequisites are lost on a VM restart, and skipping either is silent:
   you get a bind mount that resolves and is empty, or an arm64 container
   running x86-64 binaries.

### Browse the API docs locally

Generate the site into `doc/api`, then serve it. Use the pub-activated
`dartdoc`, **not** the SDK-bundled `dart doc`: dartdoc 9.0.4 (bundled with
several Flutter SDKs, including the Windows build image) crashes on any Flutter
app with a `_stripDocImports` RangeError; ≥ 9.0.9 fixes it.

`scripts/windows/Build-Windows.ps1` already does this for you as its
"Generate API Docs" step (skip it with `-SkipDocs`); the commands below are for
generating and serving the site by hand.

```bash
dart pub global activate dartdoc      # pulls >= 9.0.9
dart pub global run dartdoc --output doc/api
dart pub global activate dhttpd
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
dhttpd --path doc/api --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

On PowerShell the pub-cache `bin` goes on `PATH` differently:

```powershell
$env:Path += ";$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin"
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8080>.

| Platform Guides | [docs/source/platforms.md](docs/source/platforms.md) | Container, Windows, Raspberry Pi, and web build instructions — incl. the Windows container troubleshooting table (Dev Drive, pkg-config, rustup/Cargokit, Debug-preset pitfalls). |
| Agent / contributor guide | [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) | Build workflow, container pitfalls, and quality gates for coding agents and new contributors. |
| Known cleanups | [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) | Refactors and verification gaps this repo knows about but has not done yet, in the format ContainerHub's agentic loop consumes. |
| Camera Streaming | [docs/source/camera-streaming.md](docs/source/camera-streaming.md) | GStreamer WebRTC pipelines and Python inference demos. |
| Upgrade guide | [docs/source/upgrade-guide.md](docs/source/upgrade-guide.md) | How to keep things up-to-date. |
| Dependency upgrades | [third_party/ContainerHub/docs/dependency-updates.md](third_party/ContainerHub/docs/dependency-updates.md) | Renovate run as a local CLI. Submodule upgrades go through `bash scripts/linux/renovate-local.sh` (add `--apply` to move the gitlinks), not by hand; it does not cover `pubspec.yaml`. |

Build the full documentation website with `dart pub global run dartdoc` (see the note above — not the SDK-bundled `dart doc`). The generated site in `doc/api` now includes the guides from `docs/source`.
