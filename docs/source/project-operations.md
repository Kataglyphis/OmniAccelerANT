# Project Operations

Operational guide for contributors and maintainers.

## Daily Developer Flow

1. Update branch and submodules.
2. Run local checks (`flutter analyze`, selected tests, docs generation).
3. Verify at least one target runtime (web, linux, windows, or android).
4. Open pull request with clear scope and verification notes.

## Quality Gates

### Static checks

```bash
dart analyze
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed $(git ls-files '*.dart')
```

Never `dart format .`: it walks `flutter/`, `third_party/` and `build/`, which
`dart format` cannot be told to skip — it ignores `analysis_options.yaml`. Both
lanes list tracked files instead, which is what the command above reproduces.

### Lint gates (shell, workflows, secrets)

```bash
bash scripts/linux/run-lint-gates.sh
```

The exact command the `lint` job of `dart_on_native_linux.yml` runs — shellcheck,
actionlint (plus the CI image-reference check) and the gitleaks secret scan, all
three bootstrapped pinned from ANTfrastructure, all three run even after one fails.
These used to exist only as `run:` blocks inside the workflow, so a failing merge
gate could not be reproduced locally at all. The gitleaks arm self-tests first: an
empty tree must scan clean and a planted token must be reported and must make the
gate exit non-zero, so "found nothing" cannot be confused with "never ran".

The one gate NOT in there is `Sync-SharedConfig.ps1 -Check`, which is PowerShell;
none of ANTfrastructure's Linux images ship `pwsh`, so it stays a separate step of
the same workflow job. Run it by hand with:

```bash
pwsh -File third_party/ANTfrastructure/shared/config/Sync-SharedConfig.ps1 -RepoRoot . -Check \
  -Ignore '.clang-format,.clang-tidy,gcovr.cfg,.pre-commit-config.yaml'
```

### Tests

```bash
flutter test
flutter test integration_test/simple_test.dart
```

## Documentation Workflow

Generate docs:

```bash
bash scripts/linux/lib/generate-docs.sh
```

Preview docs:

```bash
dhttpd --path doc/api --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

### Sphinx theme (moved to DocumANTation)

The shared Sphinx theme/template that used to live in ANTfrastructure
(`sphinx-kataglyphis-theme/` + `docs/source_templates/`) was moved into the
[DocumANTation](https://github.com/Kataglyphis/DocumANTation) repository.
Consumers vendor it as a submodule (`third_party/DocumANTation`) and install it via
a docs requirements file:

```text
-e ./third_party/DocumANTation/sphinx-kataglyphis-theme
```

`conf.py` then reduces to `from sphinx_kataglyphis import setup_theme; setup_theme(globals(), ...)`.
This repo's `docs/source/conf.py` still uses the standalone `press` theme; follow the pattern
above (see ANTfrastructure's `docs/conf.py`) when migrating.

This repo no longer carries a root `requirements.txt`: the only thing it ever fed was
the cmake-format gate, which now takes its pinned bootstrap set from
`third_party/ANTfrastructure/linux/scripts/cmake-format.requirements.txt`. When the theme
migration happens, add a docs-scoped requirements file (e.g. `docs/requirements.txt`)
rather than resurrecting the root one — an unpinned root file next to a pinned shared
one is exactly the drift this removal closes.

## CI/CD Notes

- Linux native, Windows native, Web, and Android pipelines are available via GitHub Actions.
- Keep generated artifacts deterministic to reduce CI diffs and flaky builds.
- Prefer script-driven commands from `scripts/` over ad-hoc commands for reproducibility.

## Release Hygiene

- Keep dependency upgrades and feature changes in separate pull requests.
- Regenerate bridge code when Rust API signatures change.
- Update docs in the same pull request for any user-facing behavior changes.

## Troubleshooting

### flutter_rust_bridge Version Mismatch

If you encounter this error at runtime:
```
oxidant's codegen version (2.11.1) should be the same as runtime version (2.12.0)
```

**Cause:** The generated Dart binding files (in `lib/src/rust/`) are out of sync with the `pubspec.yaml` dependency version.

**Fix:** Regenerate the Flutter Rust Bridge bindings:

```bash
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate
```

It is a cargo binary baked into the build image, not a pub dependency — on a
bare host, `cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` first.

Then rebuild the project:
```bash
# For Windows
.\scripts\windows\Build-Windows.ps1 -BuildRootDir build
```

**Prevention:** Always regenerate bindings after updating `flutter_rust_bridge` version in `pubspec.yaml` or modifying Rust API signatures.
